# Installation

## Install from source

The major way to get the latest and greatest V, is to **install it from source**.
It is **easy**, and it usually takes **only a few seconds**.

### Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, etc:

You need `git`, and a C compiler like `tcc`, `gcc` or `clang`, and `make`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlang/v
cd v
make
```

See [here](https://github.com/vlang/v/wiki/Installing-a-C-compiler-on-Linux-and-macOS)
for how to install the development tools.

### Windows:

You need `git`, and a C compiler like `tcc`, `gcc`, `clang` or `msvc`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlang/v
cd v
make.bat -tcc
```

NB: You can also pass one of `-gcc`, `-msvc`, `-clang` to `make.bat` instead,
if you do prefer to use a different C compiler, but -tcc is small, fast, and
easy to install (V will download a prebuilt binary automatically).

For C compiler downloads and more info, see
[here](https://github.com/vlang/v/wiki/Installing-a-C-compiler-on-Windows).

It is recommended to add this folder to the PATH of your environment variables.
This can be done with the command `v.exe symlink`.

NB: Some antivirus programs (like Symantec) are paranoid about executables with
1 letter names (like `v.exe`). One possible workaround in that situation is
copying `v.exe` to `vlang.exe` (so that the copy is newer), or whitelisting the
V folder in your antivirus program.

### Android

Running V graphical apps on Android is also possible via [vab](https://github.com/vlang/vab).

V Android dependencies: **V**, **Java JDK** >= 8, Android **SDK + NDK**.

1. Install dependencies (see [vab](https://github.com/vlang/vab))
2. Connect your Android device
3. Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlang/vab && cd vab && v vab.v
./vab --device auto run /path/to/v/examples/sokol/particles
```
